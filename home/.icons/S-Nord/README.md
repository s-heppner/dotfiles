Most icons can be found through searching in `/usr/share/icons`.
You can then copy them into your icon pack at the same path as they were in their original icon pack and edit. 

However, some icons have uncommon names and you need to look into the `.desktop` file that launches the app.

For flatpaks, this is at `/var/lib/flatpak/app/*application_name*/current/active/files/share/applications`

For normal apps, this is in `/usr/share/applications`
